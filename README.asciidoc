OCIPv6
======

This is small and simple application for ownCloud. It sole purpose is to show
the admin the available public IPv6 addresses and let him enable/disable Teredo
to get IPv6 if he doesn't have one yet. It also handles Dynv6 dynamic DNS
service updates and can help you do IPv4 forwarding using uPnP. With uPnP it
tries to setup forwarding on port 443 which is default https port and if it
fails, it will try to do same on port 4443 as some routers doesn't allow
forwarding on https port.
